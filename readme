EVENTS AND THREADPOOL / MULTI-THREADING IN SPRING

Uses spring TaskExecutor (instead of ExecutorService in J8)
The publishes and receives an event via implementation of spring's ApplicationEventPublisher / ApplicationListener.
Then spawns a new thread, a job to persist to the db in a separate process.

Spring TaskExecutor

https://dzone.com/articles/spring-and-threads-taskexecutor

The equivalent of ExecutorService in J8.
It manages the threads of a threadpool, and adds jobs to those threads.
IE. it handles the resource intensive procedure of creating the new threads automatically

STAGES

- create the task executor (which also defines and creates the thread pool)
- define the thread (equivalent of Job in quartz scheduling)
